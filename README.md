Baseball on the Internet

Radio stations broadcast over the air and, these days, on the internet. Radio stations do not have the rights to broadcast baseball games on the internet. Mlb.tv sells a package to listen to any game from either side (and sometime in Spanish) for only $20/year and I highly recommend getting it. Their app, in general, is pretty good, too.

http://www.freebaseballradio.com - This website lists the affliate radio stations for each of the teams in baseball. The idea is that one of the affiliates will forget to block the game feed or the computer wasn’t set right. The more affiliates the better your odds. I suspect the weekend is more likely, as well.

Beside for simply not wanting to pay for the broadcast, there are other reasons to use these playlists:
- you are traveling and generally listen to the game on the radio
- you are in your hometown, but don't have access to a radio signal. for example, you are in a basement or underground.
- you are at work and don’t have a radio. in general, it’s just easier to listen on your computer.
- even if you pay for mlb.tv, they do not broadcast during rain delays. And you don’t get to hear the after-game interviews and analysis. mlb.tv can cut off the broadcast immediately after the game is over. There are also a number of blackout scenarios which make it necessary to find other sources.

Here you will find a collection of playlists for the streams from the different affiliate stations. You can import the list(s) into iTunes. Hopefully, you’ll be able to quickly cycle through the stations and find one broadcasting. Remember to check both the home and away broadcasts.
